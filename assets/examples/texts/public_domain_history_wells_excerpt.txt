THE GREEKS


Now while after Solomon (whose reign was probably about 960 B.C.) the
divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah were suffering destruction and
deportation, and while the Jewish people were developing their
tradition in captivity in Babylon, another great power over the human
mind, the Greek tradition, was also arising. While the Hebrew prophets
were working out a new sense of direct moral responsibility between the
people and an eternal and universal God of Right, the Greek
philosophers were training the human mind in a new method and spirit of
intellectual adventure.

The Greek tribes as we have told were a branch of the Aryan- speaking
stem. They had come down among the gean cities and islands some
centuries before 1000 B.C.  They were probably already in southward
movement before the Pharaoh Thothmes hunted his first elephants beyond
the conquered Euphrates.  For in those days there were elephants in
Mesopotamia and lions in Greece.

It is possible that it was a Greek raid that burnt Cnossos, but there
are no Greek legends of such a victory though there are stories of
Minos and his palace (the Labyrinth) and of the skill of the Cretan
artificers.

Like most of the Aryans these Greeks had singers and reciters whose
performances were an important social link, and these handed down from
the barbaric beginnings of their people two great epics, the _Iliad_,
telling how a league of Greek tribes besieged and took and sacked the
town of Troy in Asia Minor, and the _Odyssey_, being a long adventure
story of the return of the sage captain, Odysseus, from Troy to his own
island.  These epics were written down somewhen in the eighth or
seventh century B.C., when the Greeks had acquired the use of an
alphabet from their more civilized neighbours, but they are supposed to
have been in existence very much earlier.  Formerly they were ascribed
to a particular blind bard, Homer, who was supposed to have sat down
and composed them as Milton composed Paradise Lost. Whether there
really was such a poet, whether he composed or only wrote down and
polished these epics and so forth, is a favourite quarrelling ground
for the erudite.  We need not concern ourselves with such bickerings
here.  The thing that matters from our point of view is that the Greeks
were in possession of their epics in the eighth century B.C., and that
they were a common possession and a link between their various tribes,
giving them a sense of fellowship as against the outer barbarians. 
They were a group of kindred peoples linked by the spoken and
afterwards by the written word, and sharing common ideals of courage
and behaviour.

The epics showed the Greeks a barbaric people without iron, without
writing, and still not living in cities.  They seem to have lived at
first in open villages of huts around the halls of their chiefs outside
the ruins of the gean cities they had destroyed.  Then they began to
wall their cities and to adopt the idea of temples from the people they
had conquered.  It has been said that the cities of the primitive
civilizations grew up about the altar of some tribal god, and that the
wall was added; in the cities of the Greeks the wall preceded the
temple.  They began to trade and send out colonies.  By the seventh
century B.C. a new series of cities had grown up in the valleys and
islands of Greece, forgetful of the gean cities and civilization that
had preceded them; Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Samos, Miletus
among the chief. There were already Greek settlements along the coast
of the Black Sea and in Italy and Sicily.  The heel and toe of Italy
was called Magna Grcia.  Marseilles was a Greek town established on
the site of an earlier Phnician colony.

Now countries which are great plains or which have as a chief means of
transport some great river like the Euphrates or Nile tend to become
united under some common rule.  The cities of Egypt and the cities of
Sumeria, for example, ran together under one system of government. But
the Greek peoples were cut up among islands and mountain valleys; both
Greece and Magna Grcia are very mountainous; and the tendency was all
the other way.  When the Greeks come into history they are divided up
into a number of little states which showed no signs of coalescence. 
They are different even in race.  Some consist chiefly of citizens of
this or that Greek tribe, Ionic, olian or Doric; some have a mingled
population of Greeks and descendants of the pre-Greek Mediterranean
folk; some have an unmixed free citizenship of Greeks lording it over
an enslaved conquered population like the Helots in Sparta.  In some
the old leaderly Aryan families have become a close aristocracy; in
some there is a democracy of all the Aryan citizens; in some there are
elected or even hereditary kings, in some usurpers or tyrants.

And the same geographical conditions that kept the Greek states divided
and various, kept them small.  The largest states were smaller than
many English counties, and it is doubtful if the population of any of
their cities ever exceeded a third of a million.  Few came up even to
50,000. There were unions of interest and sympathy but no coalescences.
 Cities made leagues and alliances as trade increased, and small cities
put themselves under the protection of great ones.  Yet all Greece was
held together in a certain community of feeling by two things, by the
epics and by the custom of taking part every fourth year in the
athletic contests at Olympia.  This did not prevent wars and feuds, but
it mitigated something of the savagery of war between them, and a truce
protected all travellers to and from the games.  As time went on the
sentiment of a common heritage grew and the number of states
participating in the Olympic games increased until at last not only
Greeks but competitors from the closely kindred countries of Epirus and
Macedonia to the north were admitted.

The Greek cities grew in trade and importance, and the quality of their
civilization rose steadily in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. 
Their social life differed in many interesting points from the social
life of the gean and river valley civilizations. They had splendid
temples but the priesthood was not the great traditional body it was in
the cities of the older world, the-repository of all knowledge, the
storehouse of ideas.  They had leaders and noble families, but no
quasi- divine monarch surrounded by an elaborately organized court.
Rather their organization was aristocratic, with leading families which
kept each other in order.  Even their so- called democracies were
aristocratic; every citizen had a share in public affairs and came to
the assembly in a democracy, _but everybody was not a citizen_.  The
Greek democracies were not like our modern democracies in which
everyone has a vote.  Many of the Greek democracies had a few hundred
or a few thousand citizens and then many thousands of slaves, freedmen
and so forth, with no share in public affairs.  Generally in Greece
affairs were in the hands of a community of substantial men. Their
kings and their tyrants alike were just men set in front of other men
or usurping a leadership; they were not quasi-divine overmen like
Pharaoh or Minos or the monarchs of Mesopotamia.  Both thought and
government therefore had a freedom under Greek conditions such as they
had known in none of the older civilizations.  The Greeks had brought
down into cities the individualism, the personal initiative of the
wandering life of the northern parklands.  They were the first
republicans of importance in history.

And we find that as they emerge from a condition of barbaric warfare a
new thing becomes apparent in their intellectual life.  We find men who
are not priests seeking and recording knowledge and enquiring into the
mysteries of life and being, in a way that has hitherto been the
sublime privilege of priesthood or the presumptuous amusement of kings.
 We find already in the sixth century B.C.perhaps while Isaiah was
still prophesying in Babylonsuch men as Thales and Anaximander of
Miletus and Heraclitus of Ephesus, who were what we should now call
independent gentlemen, giving their minds to shrewd questionings of the
world in which we live, asking what its real nature was, whence it came
and what its destiny might be, and refusing all ready-made or evasive
answers.  Of these questionings of the universe by the Greek mind, we
shall have more to say a little later in this history.  These Greek
enquirers who begin to be remarkable in the sixth century B.C. are the
first philosophers, the first wisdom-lovers, in the world.

And it may be noted here how important a century this sixth century
B.C. was in the history of humanity.  For not only were these Greek
philosophers beginning the research for clear ideas about this universe
and mans place in it and Isaiah carrying Jewish prophecy to its
sublimest levels, but as we shall tell later Gautama Buddha was then
teaching in India and Confucius and Lao Tse in China. From Athens to
the Pacific the human mind was astir.




XXIV
THE WARS OF THE GREEKS AND PERSIANS


While the Greeks in the cities in Greece, South Italy and Asia Minor
were embarking upon free intellectual enquiry and while in Babylon and
Jerusalem the last of the Hebrew prophets were creating a free
conscience for mankind, two adventurous Aryan peoples, the Medes and
the Persians, were in possession of the civilization of the ancient
world and were making a great empire, the Persian empire, which was far
larger in extent than any empire the world had seen hitherto. Under
Cyrus, Babylon and the rich and ancient civilization of Lydia had been
added to the Persian rule; the Phnician cities of the Levant and all
the Greek cities in Asia Minor had been made tributary, Cambyses had
subjected Egypt, and Darius I, the Mede, the third of the Persian
rulers (521 B.C.), found himself monarch as it seemed of all the world.
His couriers rode with his decrees from the Dardanelles to the Indus
and from Upper Egypt to Central Asia.

The Greeks in Europe, it is true, Italy, Carthage, Sicily and the
Spanish Phnician settlements, were not under the Persian Peace; but
they treated it with respect and the only people who gave any serious
trouble were the old parent hordes of Nordic people in South Russia and
Central Asia, the Scythians, who raided the northern and north-eastern
borders.

Of course the population of this great Persian empire was not a
population of Persians, The Persians were only the small conquering
minority of this enormous realm.  The rest of the population was what
it had been before the Persians came from time immemorial, only that
Persian was the administrative language.  Trade and finance were still
largely Semitic, Tyre and Sidon as of old were the great Mediterranean
ports and Semitic shipping plied upon the seas.  But many of these
Semitic merchants and business people as they went from place to place
already found a sympathetic and convenient common history in the Hebrew
tradition and the Hebrew scriptures.  A new element which was
increasing rapidly in this empire was the Greek element.  The Greeks
were becoming serious rivals to the Semites upon the sea, and their
detached and vigorous intelligence made them useful and, unprejudiced
officials.

It was on account of the Scythians that Darius I invaded Europe.  He
wanted to reach South Russia, the homeland of the Scythian horsemen. 
He crossed the Bosphorus with a great army and marched through Bulgaria
to the Danube, crossed this by a bridge of boats and pushed far
northward.  His army suffered terribly.  It was largely an infantry
force and the mounted Scythians rode all round it, cut off its
supplies, destroyed any stragglers and never came to a pitched battle.
Darius was forced into an inglorious retreat.

He returned himself to Susa but he left an army in Thrace and
Macedonia, and Macedonia submitted to Darius.  Insurrections of the
Greek cities in Asia followed this failure, and the European Greeks
were drawn into the contest.  Darius resolved upon the subjugation of
the Greeks in Europe.  With the Phnician fleet at his disposal he was
able to subdue one island after another, and finally in 490 B.C. he
made his main attack upon Athens.  A considerable Armada sailed from
the ports of Asia Minor and the eastern Mediterranean, and the
expedition landed its troops at Marathon to the north of Athens.  There
they were met and signally defeated by the Athenians.

An extraordinary thing happened at this time.  The bitterest rival of
Athens in Greece was Sparta, but now Athens appealed to Sparta, sending
a herald, a swift runner, imploring the Spartans not to let Greeks
become slaves to barbarians.  This runner (the prototype of all
Marathon runners) did over a hundred miles of broken country in less
than two days.  The Spartans responded promptly and generously; but
when, in three days, the Spartan force reached Athens, there was
nothing for it to do but to view the battlefield and the bodies of the
defeated Persian soldiers.  The Persian fleet had returned to Asia.  So
ended the first Persian attack on Greece.

The next was much more impressive.  Darius died soon after the news of
his defeat at Marathon reached him, and for four years his son and
successor, Xerxes, prepared a host to crush the Greeks.  For a time
terror united all the Greeks.  The army of Xerxes was certainly the
greatest that had hitherto been assembled in the world.  It was a huge
assembly of discordant elements.  It crossed the Dardanelles, 480 B.C.,
by a bridge of boats; and along the coast as it advanced moved an
equally miscellaneous fleet carrying supplies.  At the narrow pass of
Thermopyl a small force of 1400 men under the Spartan Leonidas
resisted this multitude, and after a fight of unsurpassed heroism was
completely destroyed.  Every man was killed.  But the losses they
inflicted upon the Persians were enormous, and the army of Xerxes
pushed on to Thebes and Athens in a chastened mood. Thebes surrendered
and made terms.  The Athenians abandoned their city and it was burnt.

Greece seemed in the hands of the conqueror, but again came victory
against the odds and all expectations.  The Greek fleet, though not a
third the size of the Persian, assailed it in the bay of Salamis and
destroyed it.  Xerxes found himself and his immense army cut off from
supplies and his heart failed him.  He retreated to Asia with one half
of his army, leaving the rest to be defeated at Platea (479 B.C.) what
time the remnants of the Persian fleet were hunted down by the Greeks
and destroyed at Mycal in Asia Minor.

The Persian danger was at an end.  Most of the Greek cities in Asia
became free.  All this is told in great detail and with much
picturesqueness in the first of written histories, the _History_ of
Herodotus.  This Herodotus was born about 484 B.C. in the Ionian city
of Halicarnassus in Asia Minor, and he visited Babylon and Egypt in his
search for exact particulars.  From Mycal onward Persia sank into a
confusion of dynastic troubles.  Xerxes was murdered in 465 B.C. and
rebellions in Egypt, Syria and Media broke up the brief order of that
mighty realm.  The history of Herodotus lays stress on the weakness of
Persia.  This history is indeed what we should now call
propagandapropaganda for Greece to unite and conquer Persia. 
Herodotus makes one character, Aristagoras, go to the Spartans with a
map of the known world and say to them: These Barbarians are not
valiant in fight.  You on the other hand have now attained the utmost
skill in war .... No other nations in the world have what they possess:
gold, silver, bronze, embroidered garments, beasts and slaves. _All
this you might have for yourselves, if you so desired_.

XXV
THE SPLENDOUR OF GREECE


The century and a half that followed the defeat of Persia was one of
very great splendour for the Greek civilization. True that Greece was
torn by a desperate struggle for ascendancy between Athens, Sparta and
other states (the Peloponnesian War 431 to 404 B.C.) and that in 338
B.C. the Macedonians became virtually masters of Greece; nevertheless
during this period the thought and the creative and artistic impulse of
the Greeks rose to levels that made their achievement a lamp to mankind
for all the rest of history.

The head and centre of this mental activity was Athens.  For over
thirty years (466 to 428 B.C.) Athens was dominated by a man of great
vigour and liberality of mind, Pericles, who set himself to rebuild the
city from the ashes to which the Persians had reduced it. The beautiful
ruins that still glorify Athens to-day are chiefly the remains of this
great effort.  And he did not simply rebuild a material Athens.  He
rebuilt Athens intellectually.  He gathered about him not only
architects and sculptors but poets, dramatists, philosophers and
teachers.  Herodotus came to Athens to recite his history (438 B.C.).
Anaxagoras came with the beginnings of a scientific description of the
sun and stars.  schylus, Sophocles and Euripides one after the other
carried the Greek drama to its highest levels or beauty and nobility.

The impetus Pericles gave to the intellectual life of Athens lived on
after his death, and in spite of the fact that the peace of Greece was
now broken by the Peloponnesian War and a long and wasteful struggle
for ascendancy was beginning.  Indeed the darkling of the political
horizon seems for a time to have quickened rather than discouraged
mens minds.

Already long before the time of Pericles the peculiar freedom of Greek
institutions had given great importance to skill in discussion. 
Decision rested neither with king nor with priest but in the assemblies
of the people or of leading men.  Eloquence and able argument became
very desirable accomplishments therefore, and a class of teachers
arose, the Sophists, who undertook to strengthen young men in these
arts.  But one cannot reason without matter, and knowledge followed in
the wake of speech.  The activities and rivalries of these Sophists led
very naturally to an acute examination of style, of methods of thought
and of the validity of arguments.  When Pericles died a certain
Socrates was becoming prominent as an able and destructive critic of
bad argumentand much of the teaching of the Sophists was bad argument.
 A group of brilliant young men gathered about Socrates.  In the end
Socrates was executed for disturbing peoples minds (399 B.C.), he was
condemned after the dignified fashion of the Athens of those days to
drink in his own house and among his own friends a poisonous draught
made from hemlock, but the disturbance of peoples minds went on in
spite of his condemnation. His young men carried on his teaching.

Chief among these young men was Plato (427 to 347 B.C.) who presently
began to teach philosophy in the grove of the Academy.  His teaching
fell into two main divisions, an examination of the foundations and
methods of human thinking and an examination of political institutions.
He was the first man to write a Utopia, that is to say the plan of a
community different from and better than any existing community.  This
shows an altogether unprecedented boldness in the human mind which had
hitherto accepted social traditions and usages with scarcely a
question.  Plato said plainly to mankind: Most of the social and
political ills from which you suffer are under your control, given only
the will and courage to change them.  You can live in another and a
wiser fashion if you choose to think it out and work it out.  You are
not awake to your own power.  That is a high adventurous teaching that
has still to soak in to the common intelligence of our race.  One of
his earliest works was the Republic, a dream of a communist
aristocracy; his last unfinished work was the Laws, a scheme of
regulation for another such Utopian state.

The criticism of methods of thinking and methods of government was
carried on after Platos death by Aristotle, who had been his pupil and
who taught in the Lyceum.  Aristotle came from the city of Stagira in
Macedonia, and his father was court physician to the Macedonian king. 
For a time Aristotle was tutor to Alexander, the kings son, who was
destined to achieve very great things of which we shall soon be
telling.  Aristotles work upon methods of thinking carried the science
of Logic to a level at which it remained for fifteen hundred years or
more, until the medival schoolmen took up the ancient questions again.
 He made no Utopias.  Before man could really control his destiny as
Plato taught, Aristotle perceived that he needed far more knowledge and
far more accurate knowledge than he possessed. And so Aristotle began
that systematic collection of knowledge which nowadays we call Science.
 He sent out explorers to collect _facts_.  He was the father of
natural history.  He was the founder of political science. His students
at the Lyceum examined and compared the constitutions of 158 different
states ....

Here in the fourth century B.C. we find men who are practically modern
thinkers. The child-like, dream-like methods of primitive thought had
given way to a disciplined and critical attack upon the problems of
life.  The weird and monstrous symbolism and imagery of the gods and
god monsters, and all the taboos and awes and restraints that have
hitherto encumbered thinking are here completely set aside.  Free,
exact and systematic thinking has begun.  The fresh and unencumbered
mind of these newcomers out of the northern forests has thrust itself
into the mysteries of the temple and let the daylight in.




XXVI
THE EMPIRE OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT


From 431 to 404 B.C. the Peloponnesian War wasted Greece. Meanwhile to
the north of Greece, the kindred country of Macedonia was rising slowly
to power and civilization. The Macedonians spoke a language closely
akin to Greek, and on several occasions Macedonian competitors had
taken part in the Olympic games. In 359 B.C. a man of very great
abilities and ambition became king of this little countryPhilip.
Philip had previously been a hostage in Greece; he had had a thoroughly
Greek education and he was probably aware of the ideas of
Herodotuswhich had also been developed by the philosopher Isocratesof
a possible conquest of Asia by a consolidated Greece.

He set himself first to extend and organize his own realm and to
remodel his army.  For a thousand years now the charging horse-chariot
had been the decisive factor in battles, that and the close-fighting
infantry.  Mounted horsemen had also fought, but as a cloud of
skirmishers, individually and without discipline.  Philip made his
infantry fight in a closely packed mass, the Macedonian phalanx, and he
trained his mounted gentlemen, the knights or companions, to fight in
formation and so invented cavalry.  The master move in most of his
battles and in the battles of his son Alexander was a cavalry charge. 
The phalanx _held_ the enemy infantry in front while the cavalry swept
away the enemy horse on his wings and poured in on the flank and rear
of his infantry. Chariots were disabled by bowmen, who shot the horses.

With this new army Philip extended his frontiers through Thessaly to
Greece; and the battle of Chronia (338 B.C.), fought against Athens
and her allies, put all Greece at his feet.  At last the dream of
Herodotus was bearing fruit.  A congress of all the Greek states
appointed Philip captain-general of the Grco- Macedonian confederacy
against Persia, and in 336 B.C. his advanced guard crossed into Asia
upon this long premeditated adventure.  But he never followed it.  He
was assassinated; it is believed at the instigation of his queen
Olympias, Alexanders mother.  She was jealous because Philip had
married a second wife.

_(As in the British Museum)_


But Philip had taken unusual pains with his sons education.  He had
not only secured Aristotle, the greatest philosopher in the world, as
this boys tutor, but he had shared his ideas with him and thrust
military experience upon him.  At Chronia Alexander, who was then only
eighteen years old, had been in command of the cavalry.  And so it was
possible for this young man, who was still only twenty years old at the
time of his accession, to take up his fathers task at once and to
proceed successfully with the Persian adventure.

In 334 B.C.for two years were needed to establish and confirm his
position in Macedonia and Greecehe crossed into Asia, defeated a not
very much bigger Persian army at the battle of the Granicus and
captured a number of cities in Asia Minor.  He kept along the
sea-coast.  It was necessary for him to reduce and garrison all the
coast towns as he advanced because the Persians had control of the
fleets of Tyre and Sidon and so had command of the sea.  Had he left a
hostile port in his rear the Persians might have landed forces to raid
his communications and cut him off. At  Issus (333 B.C.) he met and
smashed a vast conglomerate host under Darius III.  Like the host of
Xerxes that had crossed the Dardanelles a century and a half before, it
was an incoherent accumulation of contingents and it was encumbered
with a multitude of court officials, the harem of Darius and many camp
followers.  Sidon surrendered to Alexander but Tyre resisted
obstinately.  Finally that great city was stormed and plundered and
destroyed.  Gaza also was stormed, and towards the end of 332 B.C. the
conqueror entered Egypt and took over its rule from the Persians.

At Alexandretta and at Alexandria in Egypt he built great cities,
accessible from the land and so incapable of revolt. To these the trade
of the Phnician cities was diverted. The Phnicians of the western
Mediterranean suddenly disappear from historyand as immediately the
Jews of Alexandria and the other new trading cities created by
Alexander appear.

In 331 B.C. Alexander marched out of Egypt upon Babylon as Thothmes and
Rameses and Necho had done before him.  But he marched by way of Tyre. 
At Arbela near the ruins of Nineveh, which was already a forgotten
city, he met Darius and fought the decisive battle of the war.  The
Persian chariot charge failed, a Macedonian cavalry charge broke up the
great composite host and the phalanx completed the victory.  Darius led
the retreat.  He made no further attempt to resist the invader but fled
northward into the country of the Medes.  Alexander marched on to
Babylon, still prosperous and important, and then to Susa and
Persepolis.  There after a drunken festival he burnt down the palace of
Darius, the king of kings.

Thence Alexander presently made a military parade of central Asia,
going to the utmost bounds of the Persian empire.  At first he turned
northward.  Darius was pursued; and he was overtaken at dawn dying in
his chariot, having been murdered by his own people.  He was still
living when the foremost Greeks reached him.  Alexander came up to find
him dead. Alexander skirted the Caspian Sea, he went up into the
mountains of western Turkestan, he came down by Herat (which he
founded) and Cabul and the Khyber Pass into India.  He fought a great
battle on the Indus with an Indian king, Porus, and here the Macedonian
troops met elephants for the first time and defeated them.  Finally he
built himself ships, sailed down to the mouth of the Indus, and marched
back by the coast of Beluchistan, reaching Susa again in 324 B.C. after
an absence of six years. He then prepared to consolidate and organize
this vast empire he had won.  He sought to win over his new subjects. 
He assumed the robes and tiara of a Persian monarch, and this roused
the jealousy of his Macedonian commanders.  He had much trouble with
them.  He arranged a number of marriages between these Macedonian
officers and Persian and Babylonian women: the Marriage of the East
and West.  He never lived to effect the consolidation he had planned. 
A fever seized him after a drinking bout in Babylon and he died in 323
B.C.

Immediately this vast dominion fell to pieces.  One of his generals,
Seleucus, retained most of the old Persian empire from the Indus to
Ephesus; another, Ptolemy, seized Egypt, and Antigonus secured
Macedonia.  The rest of the empire remained unstable, passing under the
control of a succession of local adventurers.  Barbarian raids began
from the north and grew in scope and intensity.  Until at last, as we
shall tell, a new power, the power of the Roman republic, came out of
the west to subjugate one fragment after another and weld them together
into a new and more enduring empire.




XXVII
THE MUSEUM AND LIBRARY AT ALEXANDRIA


Before the time of Alexander Greeks had already been spreading as
merchants, artists, officials, mercenary soldiers, over most of the
Persian dominions. In the dynastic disputes that followed the death of
Xerxes, a band of ten thousand Greek mercenaries played a part under
the leadership of Xenophon. Their return to Asiatic Greece from Babylon
is described in his _Retreat of the Ten Thousand_, one of the first war
stories that was ever written by a general in command. But the
conquests of Alexander and the division of his brief empire among his
subordinate generals, greatly stimulated this permeation of the ancient
world by the Greeks and their language and fashions and culture. Traces
of this Greek dissemination are to be found far away in central Asia
and in north-west India. Their influence upon the development of Indian
art was profound.

For many centuries Athens retained her prestige as a centre of art and
culture; her schools went on indeed to 529 A.D., that is to say for
nearly a thousand years; but the leadership in the intellectual
activity of the world passed presently across the Mediterranean to
Alexandria, the new trading city that Alexander had founded. Here the
Macedonian general Ptolemy had become Pharaoh, with a court that spoke
Greek.  He had become an intimate of Alexander before he became king,
and he was deeply saturated with the ideas of Aristotle.  He set
himself, with great energy and capacity, to organize knowledge and
investigation. He also wrote a history of Alexanders campaigns which,
unhappily, is lost to the world.

Alexander had already devoted considerable sums to finance the
enquiries of Aristotle, but Ptolemy I was the first person to make a
permanent endowment of science.  He set up a foundation in Alexandria
which was formerly dedicated to the Muses, the Museum of Alexandria. 
For two or three generations the scientific work done at Alexandria was
extraordinarily good.  Euclid, Eratosthenes who measured the size of
the earth and came within fifty miles of its true diameter, Apollonius
who wrote on conic sections, Hipparchus who made the first star map and
catalogue, and Hero who devised the first steam engine are among the
greater stars of an extraordinary constellation of scientific pioneers.
Archimedes came from Syracuse to Alexandria to study, and was a
frequent correspondent of the Museum.  Herophilus was one of the
greatest of Greek anatomists, and is said to have practised
vivisection.

For a generation or so during the reigns of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II
there was such a blaze of knowledge and discovery at Alexandria as the
world was not to see again until the sixteenth century A.D.  But it did
not continue.  There may have been several causes of this decline. 
Chief among them, the late Professor Mahaffy suggested, was the fact
that the Museum was a royal college and all its professors and
fellows were appointed and paid by Pharaoh.  This was all very well
when Pharaoh was Ptolemy I, the pupil and friend of Aristotle.  But as
the dynasty of the Ptolemies went on they became Egyptianized, they
fell under the sway of Egyptian priests and Egyptian religious
developments, they ceased to follow the work that was done, and their
control stifled the spirit of enquiry altogether.  The Museum produced
little good work after its first century of activity.

Ptolemy I not only sought in the most modern spirit to organize the
finding of fresh knowledge.  He tried also to set up an encyclopdic
storehouse of wisdom in the Library of Alexandria.  It was not simply a
storehouse, it was also a book-copying and book-selling organization. 
A great army of copyists was set to work perpetually multiplying copies
of books.

Here then we have the definite first opening up of the intellectual
process in which we live to-day; here we have the systematic gathering
and distribution of knowledge.  The foundation of this Museum and
Library marks one of the great epochs in the history of mankind.  It is
the true beginning of Modern History.

Both the work of research and the work of dissemination went on under
serious handicaps.  One of these was the great social gap that
separated the philosopher, who was a gentleman, from the trader and the
artisan.  There were glass workers and metal workers in abundance in
those days, but they were not in mental contact with the thinkers.  The
glass worker was making the most beautifully coloured beads and phials
and so forth, but he never made a Florentine flask or a lens.  Clear
glass does not seem to have interested him. The metal worker made
weapons and jewellery but he never made a chemical balance.  The
philosopher speculated loftily about atoms and the nature of things,
but he had no practical experience of enamels and pigments and philters
and so forth. He was not interested in substances.  So Alexandria in
its brief day of opportunity produced no microscopes and no chemistry. 
And though Hero invented a steam engine it was never set either to pump
or drive a boat or do any useful thing.  There were few practical
applications of science except in the realm of medicine, and the
progress of science was not stimulated and sustained by the interest
and excitement of practical applications.  There was nothing to keep
the work going therefore when the intellectual curiosity of Ptolemy I
and Ptolemy II was withdrawn.  The discoveries of the Museum went on
record in obscure manuscripts and never, until the revival of
scientific curiosity at the Renascence, reached out to the mass of
mankind.

Nor did the Library produce any improvements in book making. That
ancient world had no paper made in definite sizes from rag pulp.  Paper
was a Chinese invention and it did not reach the western world until
the ninth century A.D.  The only book materials were parchment and
strips of the papyrus reed joined edge to edge.  These strips were kept
on rolls which were very unwieldy to wind to and fro and read, and very
inconvenient for reference.  It was these things that prevented the
development of paged and printed books.  Printing itself was known in
the world it would seem as early as the Old Stone Age; there were seals
in ancient Sumeria; but without abundant paper there was little
advantage in printing books, an improvement that may further have been
resisted by trades unionism on the part of the copyists employed. 
Alexandria produced abundant books but not cheap books, and it never
spread knowledge into the population of the ancient world below the
level of a wealthy and influential class.

So it was that this blaze of intellectual enterprise never reached
beyond a small circle of people in touch with the group of philosophers
collected by the first two Ptolemies. It was like the light in a dark
lantern which is shut off from the world at large.  Within the blaze
may be blindingly bright, but nevertheless it is unseen.  The rest of
the world went on its old ways unaware that the seed of scientific
knowledge that was one day to revolutionize it altogether had been
sown.  Presently a darkness of bigotry fell even upon Alexandria.
Thereafter for a thousand years of darkness the seed that Aristotle had
sown lay hidden.  Then it stirred and began to germinate.  In a few
centuries it had become that widespread growth of knowledge and clear
ideas that is now changing the whole of human life.

Alexandria was not the only centre of Greek intellectual activity in
the third century B.C. There were many other cities that displayed a
brilliant intellectual life amidst the disintegrating fragments of the
brief empire of Alexander.  There was, for example, the Greek city of
Syracuse in Sicily, where thought and science flourished for two
centuries; there was Pergamum in Asia Minor, which also had a great
library.  But this brilliant Hellenic world was now stricken by
invasion from the north. New Nordic barbarians, the Gauls, were
striking down along the tracks that had once been followed by the
ancestors of the Greeks and Phrygians and Macedonians.  They raided,
shattered and destroyed.  And in the wake of the Gauls came a new
conquering people out of Italy, the Romans, who gradually subjugated
all the western half of the vast realm of Darius and Alexander.  They
were an able but unimaginative people, preferring law and profit to
either science or art.  New invaders were also coming down out of
central Asia to shatter and subdue the Seleucid empire and to cut off
the western world again from India.  These were the Parthians, hosts of
mounted bowmen, who treated the Grco-Persian empire of Persepolis and
Susa in the third century B.C. in much the same fashion that the Medes
and Persians had treated it in the seventh and sixth.  And there were
now other nomadic peoples also coming out of the northeast, peoples who
were not fair and Nordic and Aryan- speaking but yellow-skinned and
black-haired and with a Mongolian speech.  But of these latter people
we shall tell more in a subsequent chapter.




XXVIII
THE LIFE OF GAUTAMA BUDDHA


But now we must go back three centuries in our story to tell of a great
teacher who came near to revolutionizing the religious thought and
feeling of all Asia. This was Gautama Buddha, who taught his disciples
at Benares in India about the same time that Isaiah was prophesying
among the Jews in Babylon and Heraclitus was carrying on his
speculative enquiries into the nature of things at Ephesus. All these
men were in the world at the same time, in the sixth century
B.C.unaware of one another.

This sixth century B.C. was indeed one of the most remarkable in all
history. Everywherefor as we shall tell it was also the case in
Chinamens minds were displaying a new boldness. Everywhere they were
waking up out of the traditions of kingships and priests and blood
sacrifices and asking the most penetrating questions.  It is as if the
race had reached a stage of adolescenceafter a childhood of twenty
thousand years.

The early history of India is still very obscure.  Somewhen perhaps
about 2000 B.C., an Aryan- speaking people came down from the
north-west into India either in one invasion or in a series of
invasions; and was able to spread its language and traditions over most
of north India.  Its peculiar variety of Aryan speech was the Sanskrit.
 They found a brunette people with a more elaborate civilization and
less vigour of will, in possession of the country of the Indus and
Ganges.  But they do not seem to have mingled with their predecessors
as freely as did the Greeks and Persians.  They remained aloof.  When
the past of India becomes dimly visible to the historian, Indian
society is already stratified into several layers, with a variable
number of sub-divisions, which do not eat together nor intermarry nor
associate freely.  And throughout history this stratification into
castes continues.  This makes the Indian population something different
from the simple, freely inter-breeding European or Mongolian
communities.  It is really a community of communities.

Siddhattha Gautama was the son of an aristocratic family which ruled a
small district on the Himalayan slopes.  He was married at nineteen to
a beautiful cousin.  He hunted and played and went about in his sunny
world of gardens and groves and irrigated rice-fields.  And it was
amidst this life that a great discontent fell upon him.  It was the
unhappiness of a fine brain that seeks employment.  He felt that the
existence he was leading was not the reality of life, but a holidaya
holiday that had gone on too long.

The sense of disease and mortality, the insecurity and the
un-satisfactoriness of all happiness, descended upon the mind of
Gautama.  While he was in this mood he met one of those wandering
ascetics who already existed in great numbers in India.  These men
lived under severe rules, spending much time in meditation and in
religious discussion.  They were supposed to be seeking some deeper
reality in life, and a passionate desire to do likewise took possession
of Gautama.

He was meditating upon this project, says the story, when the news was
brought to him that his wife had been delivered of his first-born son.
This is another tie to break, said Gautama.

He returned to the village amidst the rejoicings of his fellow
clansmen.  There was a great feast and a Nautch dance to celebrate the
birth of this new tie, and in the night Gautama awoke in a great agony
of spirit, like a man who is told that his house is on fire.  He
resolved to leave his happy aimless life forthwith.  He went softly to
the threshold of his wifes chamber, and saw her by the light of a
little oil lamp, sleeping sweetly, surrounded by flowers, with his
infant son in her arms.  He felt a great craving to take up the child
in one first and last embrace before he departed, but the fear of
waking his wife prevented him, and at last he turned away and went out
into the bright Indian moonshine and mounted his horse and rode off
into the world.

Very far he rode that night, and in the morning he stopped outside the
lands of his clan, and dismounted beside a sandy river.  There he cut
off his flowing locks with his sword, removed all his ornaments and
sent them and his horse and sword back to his house.  Going on he
presently met a ragged man and exchanged clothes with him, and so
having divested himself of all worldly entanglements he was free to
pursue his search after wisdom. He made his way southward to a resort
of hermits and teachers in a hilly spur of the Vindhya Mountains. 
There lived a number of wise men in a warren of caves, going into the
town for their simple supplies and imparting their knowledge by word of
mouth to such as cared to come to them.  Gautama became versed in all
the metaphysics of his age.  But his acute intelligence was
dissatisfied with the solutions offered him.

The Indian mind has always been disposed to believe that power and
knowledge may be obtained by extreme asceticism, by fasting,
sleeplessness, and self-torment, and these ideas Gautama now put to the
test.  He betook himself with five disciple companions to the jungle
and there he gave himself up to fasting and terrible penances.  His
fame spread, like the sound of a great bell hung in the canopy of the
skies.  But it brought him no sense of truth achieved. One day he was
walking up and down, trying to think in spite of his enfeebled state. 
Suddenly he fell unconscious.  When he recovered, the preposterousness
of these semi-magical ways to wisdom was plain to him.

He horrified his companions by demanding ordinary food and refusing to
continue his mortifications.  He had realized that whatever truth a man
may reach is reached best by a nourished brain in a healthy body.  Such
a conception was absolutely foreign to the ideas of the land and age. 
His disciples deserted him, and went off in a melancholy state to
Benares.  Gautama wandered alone.

When the mind grapples with a great and intricate problem, it makes its
advances step by step, with but little realization of the gains it has
made, until suddenly, with an effect of abrupt illumination, it
realizes its victory.  So it happened to Gautama.  He had seated
himself under a great tree by the side of a river to eat, when this
sense of clear vision came to him.  It seemed to him that he saw life
plain.  He is said to have sat all day and all night in profound
thought, and then he rose up to impart his vision to the world.

He went on to Benares and there he sought out and won back his lost
disciples to his new teaching.  In the Kings Deer Park at Benares they
built themselves huts and set up a sort of school to which came many
who were seeking after wisdom.

The starting point of his teaching was his own question as a fortunate
young man, Why am I not completely happy?  It was an introspective
question. It was a question very different in quality from the frank
and self-forgetful _externalized_ curiosity with which Thales and
Heraclitus were attacking the problems of the universe, or the equally
self-forgetful burthen of moral obligation that the culminating
prophets were imposing upon the Hebrew mind.  The Indian teacher did
not forget self, he concentrated upon self and sought to destroy it. 
All suffering, he taught, was due to the greedy desires of the
individual.  Until man has conquered his personal cravings his life is
trouble and his end sorrow.  There were three principal forms that the
craving for life took and they were all evil.  The first was the desire
of the appetites, greed and all forms of sensuousness, the second was
the desire for a personal and egotistic immortality, the third was the
craving for personal success, worldliness, avarice and the like.  All
these forms of desire had to be overcome to escape from the distresses
and chagrins of life.  When they were overcome, when self had vanished
altogether, then serenity of soul, Nirvana, the highest good was
attained.

This was the gist of his teaching, a very subtle and metaphysical
teaching indeed, not nearly so easy to understand as the Greek
injunction to see and know fearlessly and rightly and the Hebrew
command to fear God and accomplish righteousness.  It was a teaching
much beyond the understanding of even Gautamas immediate disciples,
and it is no wonder that so soon as his personal influence was
withdrawn it became corrupted and coarsened.  There was a widespread
belief in India at that time that at long intervals Wisdom came to
earth and was incarnate in some chosen person who was known as the
Buddha.  Gautamas disciples declared that he was a Buddha, the latest
of the Buddhas, though there is no evidence that he himself ever
accepted the title.  Before he was well dead, a cycle of fantastic
legends began to be woven about him.  The human heart has always
preferred a wonder story to a moral effort, and Gautama Buddha became
very wonderful.

Yet there remained a substantial gain in the world.  If Nirvana was too
high and subtle for most mens imaginations, if the myth-making impulse
in the race was too strong for the simple facts of Gautamas life, they
could at least grasp something of the intention of what Gautama called
the Eight-fold way, the Aryan or Noble Path in life.  In this there was
an insistence upon mental uprightness, upon right aims and speech,
right conduct and honest livelihood.  There was a quickening of the
conscience and an appeal to generous and self-forgetful ends.




XXIX
KING ASOKA


For some generations after the death of Gautama, these high and noble
Buddhist teachings, this first plain teaching that the highest good for
man is the subjugation of self, made comparatively little headway in
the world. Then they conquered the imagination of one of the greatest
monarchs the world has ever seen.

We have already mentioned how Alexander the Great came down into India
and fought with Porus upon the Indus.  It is related by the Greek
historians that a certain Chandragupta Maurya came into Alexanders
camp and tried to persuade him to go on to the Ganges and conquer all
India. Alexander could not do this because of the refusal of his
Macedonians to go further into what was for them an unknown world, and
later on (303 B.C.) Chandragupta was able to secure the help or various
hill tribes and realize his dream without Greek help. He built up an
empire in North India and was presently (303 B.C.) able to attack
Seleucus I in the Punjab and drive the last vestige of Greek power out
of India. His son extended this new empire. His grandson, Asoka, the
monarch of whom we now have to tell, found himself in 264 B.C. ruling
from Afghanistan to Madras.

Asoka was at first disposed to follow the example of his father and
grandfather and complete the conquest of the Indian peninsula.  He
invaded Kalinga (255 B.C.), a country on the east coast of Madras, he
was successful in his military operations andalone among conquerorshe
was so disgusted by the cruelty and horror of war that he renounced it.
 He would have no more of it.  He adopted the peaceful doctrines of
Buddhism and declared that henceforth his conquests should be the
conquests of religion.

His reign for eight-and-twenty years was one of the brightest
interludes in the troubled history of mankind.  He organized a great
digging of wells in India and the planting of trees for shade.  He
founded hospitals and public gardens and gardens for the growing of
medicinal herbs.  He created a ministry for the care of the aborigines
and subject races of India. He made provision for the education of
women.  He made vast benefactions to the Buddhist teaching orders, and
tried to stimulate them to a better and more energetic criticism of
their own accumulated literature.  For corruptions and superstitious
accretions had accumulated very speedily upon the pure and simple
teaching of the great Indian master. Missionaries went from Asoka to
Kashmir, to Persia, to Ceylon and Alexandria.

Such was Asoka, greatest of kings.  He was far in advance of his age. 
He left no prince and no organization of men to carry on his work, and
within a century of his death the great days of his reign had become a
glorious memory in a shattered and decaying India.  The priestly caste
of the Brahmins, the highest and most privileged caste in the Indian
social body, has always been opposed to the frank and open teaching of
Buddha.  Gradually they undermined the Buddhist influence in the land. 
The old monstrous gods, the innumerable cults of Hinduism, resumed
their sway.  Caste became more rigorous and complicated. For long
centuries Buddhism and Brahminism flourished side by side, and then
slowly Buddhism decayed and Brahminism in a multitude of forms replaced
it.  But beyond the confines of India and the realms of caste Buddhism
spreaduntil it had won China and Siam and Burma and Japan, countries
in which it is predominant to this day.

XXX
CONFUCIUS AND LAO TSE


We have still to tell of two other great men, Confucius and Lao Tse,
who lived in that wonderful century which began the adolescence of
mankind, the sixth century B.C. In this history thus far we have told
very little of the early story of China. At present that early history
is still very obscure, and we look to Chinese explorers and
archolologists in the new China that is now arising to work out their
past as thoroughly as the European past has been worked out during the
last century. Very long ago the first primitive Chinese civilizations
arose in the great river valleys out of the primordial heliolithic
culture. They had, like Egypt and Sumeria, the general characteristics
of that culture, and they centred upon temples in which priests and
priest kings offered the seasonal blood sacrifices. The life in those
cities must have been very like the Egyptian and Sumerian life of six
or seven thousand years ago and very like the Maya life of Central
America a thousand years ago.

If there were human sacrifices they had long given way to animal
sacrifices before the dawn of history.  And a form of picture writing
was growing up long before a thousand years B.C.

And just as the primitive civilizations of Europe and western Asia were
in conflict with the nomads of the desert and the nomads of the north,
so the primitive Chinese civilizations had a great cloud of nomadic
peoples on their northern borders.  There was a number of tribes akin
in language and ways of living, who are spoken of in history in
succession as the Huns, the Mongols, the Turks and Tartars.  They
changed and divided and combined and re-combined, just as the Nordic
peoples in north Europe and central Asia changed and varied in name
rather than in nature.  These Mongolian nomads had horses earlier than
the Nordic peoples, and it may be that in the region of the Altai
Mountains they made an independent discovery of iron somewhen after
1000 B.C. And just as in the western case so ever and again these
eastern nomads would achieve a sort of political unity, and become the
conquerors and masters and revivers of this or that settled and
civilized region.

It is quite possible that the earliest civilization of China was not
Mongolian at all any more than the earliest civilization of Europe and
western Asia was Nordic or Semitic.  It is quite possible that the
earliest civilization of China was a brunette civilization and of a
piece with the earliest Egyptian, Sumerian and Dravidian civilizations,
and that when the first recorded history of China began there had
already been conquests and intermixture.  At any rate we find that by
1750 B.C. China was already a vast system of little kingdoms and city
states, all acknowledging a loose allegiance and paying more or less
regularly, more or less definite feudal dues to one great priest
emperor, the Son of Heaven.  The Shang dynasty came to an end in
1125 B.C.  A Chow dynasty succeeded Shang, and maintained China in
a relaxing unity until the days of Asoka in India and of the Ptolemies
in Egypt.  Gradually China went to pieces during that long Chow
period.  Hunnish peoples came down and set up principalities; local
rulers discontinued their tribute and became independent.  There was in
the sixth century B.C., says one Chinese authority, five or six
thousand practically independent states in China.  It was what the
Chinese call in their records an Age of Confusion.

But this Age of Confusion was compatible with much intellectual
activity and with the existence of many local centres of art and
civilized living.  When we know more of Chinese history we shall find
that China also had her Miletus and her Athens, her Pergamum and her
Macedonia.  At present we must be vague and brief about this period of
Chinese division simply because our knowledge is not sufficient for us
to frame a coherent and consecutive story.


CONFUCIUS
CONFUCIUS

(Chavannes))_


And just as in divided Greece there were philosophers and in shattered
and captive Jewry prophets, so in disordered China there were
philosophers and teachers at this time.  In all these cases insecurity
and uncertainty seemed to have quickened the better sort of mind. 
Confucius was a man of aristocratic origin and some official importance
in a small state called Lu.  Here in a very parallel mood to the Greek
impulse he set up a sort of Academy for discovering and teaching
Wisdom.  The lawlessness and disorder of China distressed him
profoundly.  He conceived an ideal of a better government and a better
life, and travelled from state to state seeking a prince who would
carry out his legislative and educational ideas.  He never found his
prince; he found a prince, but court intrigues undermined the influence
of the teacher and finally defeated his reforming proposals.  It is
interesting to note that a century and a half later the Greek
philosopher Plato also sought a prince, and was for a time adviser to
the tyrant Dionysius who ruled Syracuse in Sicily.

Confucius died a disappointed man.  No intelligent ruler arises to
take me as his master, he said, and my time has come to die.  But
his teaching had more vitality than he imagined in his declining and
hopeless years, and it became a great formative influence with the
Chinese people.  It became one of what the Chinese call the Three
Teachings, the other two being those of Buddha and of Lao Tse.

The gist of the teaching of Confucius was the way of the noble or
aristocratic man.  He was concerned with personal conduct as much as
Gautama was concerned with the peace of self-forgetfulness and the
Greek with external knowledge and the Jew with righteousness.  He was
the most public-minded of all great teachers.  He was supremely
concerned by the confusion and miseries of the world, and he wanted to
make men noble in order to bring about a noble world.  He sought to
regulate conduct to an extraordinary extent; to provide sound rules for
every occasion in life.  A polite, public- spirited gentleman, rather
sternly self-disciplined, was the ideal he found already developing in
the northern Chinese world and one to which he gave a permanent form.

The teaching of Lao Tse, who was for a long time in charge of the
imperial library of the Chow dynasty, was much more mystical and vague
and elusive than that of Confucius.  He seems to have preached a
stoical indifference to the pleasures and powers of the world and a
return to an imaginary simple life of the past.  He left writings very
contracted in style and very obscure.  He wrote in riddles.  After his
death his teachings, like the teachings of Gautama Buddha, were
corrupted and overlaid by legends and had the most complex and
extraordinary observances and superstitious ideas grafted upon them. 
In China just as in India primordial ideas of magic and monstrous
legends out of the childish past of our race struggled against the new
thinking in the world and succeeded in plastering it over with
grotesque, irrational and antiquated observances.  Both Buddhism and
Taoism (which ascribes itself largely to Lao Tse) as one finds them in
China now, are religions of monk, temple, priest and offering of a type
as ancient in form, if not in thought, as the sacrificial religions of
ancient Sumeria and Egypt.  But the teaching of Confucius was not so
overlaid because it was limited and plain and straightforward and lent
itself to no such distortions.

North China, the China of the Hwang-ho River, became Confucian in
thought and spirit; south China, Yang-tse-Kiang China, became Taoist. 
Since those days a conflict has always been traceable in Chinese
affairs between these two spirits, the spirit of the north and the
spirit of the south, between (in latter times) Pekin and Nankin,
between the official- minded, upright and conservative north, and the
sceptical, artistic, lax and experimental south.

The divisions of China of the Age of Confusion reached their worst
stage in the sixth century B.C. The Chow dynasty was so enfeebled and
so discredited that Lao Tse left the unhappy court and retired into
private life.

Three nominally subordinate powers dominated the situation in those
days, Tsi and Tsin, both northern powers, and Chu, which was an
aggressive military power in the Yangtse valley.  At last Tsi and
Tsin formed an alliance, subdued Chu and imposed a general treaty of
disarmament and peace in China.  The power of Tsin became predominant.
 Finally about the time of Asoka in India the Tsin monarch seized upon
the sacrificial vessels of the Chow emperor and took over his
sacrificial duties. His son, Shi-Hwang-ti (king in 246 B.C., emperor in
220 B.C.), is called in the Chinese Chronicles the First Universal
Emperor.

More fortunate than Alexander, Shi-Hwang-ti reigned for thirty-six
years as king and emperor.  His energetic reign marks the beginning of
a new era of unity and prosperity for the Chinese people.  He fought
vigorously against the Hunnish invaders from the northern deserts, and
he began that immense work, the Great Wall of China, to set a limit to
their incursions.




XXXI
ROME COMES INTO HISTORY


The reader will note a general similarity in the history of all these
civilizations in spite of the effectual separation caused by the great
barriers of the Indian north-west frontier and of the mountain masses
of Central Asia and further India. First for thousands of years the
heliolithic culture spread over all the warm and fertile river valleys
of the old world and developed a temple system and priest rulers about
its sacrificial traditions. Apparently its first makers were always
those brunette peoples we have spoken of as the central race of
mankind. Then the nomads came in from the regions of seasonal grass and
seasonal migrations and superposed their own characteristics and often
their own language on the primitive civilization. They subjugated and
stimulated it, and were stimulated to fresh developments and made it
here one thing and here another. In Mesopotamia it was the Elamite and
then the Semite, and at last the Nordic Medes and Persians and the
Greeks who supplied the ferment; over the region of the gean peoples
it was the Greeks; in India it was the Aryan-speakers; in Egypt there
was a thinner infusion of conquerors into a more intensely saturated
priestly civilization; in China, the Hun conquered and was absorbed and
was followed by fresh Huns. China was Mongolized just as Greece and
North India were Aryanized and Mesopotamia Semitized and Aryanized.
Everywhere the nomads destroyed much, but everywhere they brought in a
new spirit of free enquiry and moral innovation. They questioned the
beliefs of immemorial ages. They let daylight into the temples. They
set up kings who were neither priests nor gods but mere leaders among
their captains and companions.

In the centuries following the sixth century B.C. we find everywhere a
great breaking down of ancient traditions and a new spirit of moral and
intellectual enquiry awake, a spirit never more to be altogether
stilled in the great progressive movement of mankind.  We find reading
and writing becoming common and accessible accomplishments among the
ruling and prosperous minority; they were no longer the jealously
guarded secret of the priests.  Travel is increasing and transport
growing easier by reason of horses and roads.  A new and easy device to
facilitate trade has been found in coined money.

Let us now transfer our attention back from China in the extreme east
of the old world to the western half of the Mediterranean.  Here we
have to note the appearance of a city which was destined to play at
last a very great part indeed in human affairs, Rome.

Hitherto we have told very little about Italy in our story. It was
before 1000 B.C. a land of mountain and forest and thinly populated. 
Aryan-speaking tribes had pressed down this peninsula and formed little
towns and cities, and the southern extremity was studded with Greek
settlements.  The noble ruins of Pstum preserve for us to this day
something of the dignity and splendour of these early Greek
establishments.  A non-Aryan people, probably akin to the gean
peoples, the Etruscans, had established themselves in the central part
of the peninsula. They had reversed the usual process by subjugating
various Aryan tribes.  Rome, when it comes into the light of history,
is a little trading city at a ford on the Tiber, with a Latin-speaking
population ruled over by Etruscan kings.  The old chronologies gave 753
B.C. as the date of the founding of Rome, half a century later than the
founding of the great Phnician city of Carthage and twenty-three years
after the first Olympiad.  Etruscan tombs of a much earlier date than
753 B.C. have, however, been excavated in the Roman Forum.

In that red-letter century, the sixth century B.C., the Etruscan kings
were expelled (510 B.C.) and Rome became an aristocratic republic with
a lordly class of patrician families dominating a commonalty of
plebeians. Except that it spoke Latin it was not unlike many
aristocratic Greek republics.

For some centuries the internal history of Rome was the story of a long
and obstinate struggle for freedom and a share in the government on the
part of the plebeians.  It would not be difficult to find Greek
parallels to this conflict, which the Greeks would have called a
conflict of aristocracy with democracy.  In the end the plebeians broke
down most of the exclusive barriers of the old families and established
a working equality with them.  They destroyed the old exclusiveness,
and made it possible and acceptable for Rome to extend her citizenship
by the inclusion of more and more outsiders.  For while she still
struggled at home, she was extending her power abroad.

The extension of Roman power began in the fifth century B.C.  Until
that time they had waged war, and generally unsuccessful war, with the
Etruscans.  There was an Etruscan fort, Veii, only a few miles from
Rome which the Romans had never been able to capture.  In 474 B.C.,
however, a great misfortune came to the Etruscans.  Their fleet was
destroyed by the Greeks of Syracuse in Sicily.  At the same time a wave
of Nordic invaders came down upon them from the north, the Gauls.
Caught between Roman and Gaul, the Etruscans felland disappear from
history.  Veii was captured by the Romans, The Gauls came through to
Rome and sacked the city (390 B.C.A.D.) but could not capture the
Capitol. An attempted night surprise was betrayed by the cackling of
some geese, and finally the invaders were bought off and retired to the
north of Italy again.

The Gaulish raid seems to have invigorated rather than weakened Rome. 
The Romans conquered and assimilated the Etruscans, and extended their
power over all central Italy from the Arno to Naples.  To this they had
reached within a few years of 300 B.C.  Their conquests in Italy were
going on simultaneously with the growth of Philips power in Macedonia
and Greece, and the tremendous raid of Alexander to Egypt and the
Indus.  The Romans had become notable people in the civilized world to
the east of them by the break-up of Alexanders empire.

To the north of the Roman power were the Gauls; to the south of them
were the Greek settlements of Magna Grcia, that is to say of Sicily
and of the toe and heel of Italy.  The Gauls were a hardy, warlike
people and the Romans held that boundary by a line of forts and
fortified settlements.  The Greek cities in the south headed by
Tarentum (now Taranto) and by Syracuse in Sicily, did not so much
threaten as fear the Romans.  They looked about for some help against
these new conquerors.

We have already told how the empire of Alexander fell to pieces and was
divided among his generals and companions. Among these adventurers was
a kinsman of Alexanders named Pyrrhus, who established himself in
Epirus, which is across the Adriatic Sea over against the heel of
Italy.  It was his ambition to play the part of Philip of Macedonia to
Magna Grcia, and to become protector and master-general of Tarentum,
Syracuse and the rest of that part of the world. He had what was then
it very efficient modern army; he had an infantry phalanx, cavalry from
Thessalywhich was now quite as good as the original Macedonian
cavalryand twenty fighting elephants; he invaded Italy and routed the
Romans in two considerable battles, Heraclea (280 B.C.) and Ausculum
(279 B.C.), and having driven them north, he turned his attention to
the subjugation of Sicily.

But this brought against him a more formidable enemy than were the
Romans at that time, the Phnician trading city of Carthage, which was
probably then the greatest city in the world.  Sicily was too near
Carthage for a new Alexander to be welcome there, and Carthage was
mindful of the fate that had befallen her mother city Tyre half a
century before.  So she sent a fleet to encourage or compel Rome to
continue the struggle, and she cut the overseas communications of
Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus found himself freshly assailed by the Romans, and
suffered a disastrous repulse in an attack he had made upon their camp
at Beneventum between Naples and Rome.

And suddenly came news that recalled him to Epirus.  The Gauls were
raiding south.  But this time they were not raiding down into Italy;
the Roman frontier, fortified and guarded, had become too formidable
for them.  They were raiding down through Illyria (which is now Serbia
and Albania) to Macedonia and Epirus.  Repulsed by the Romans,
endangered at sea by the Carthaginians, and threatened at home by the
Gauls, Pyrrhus abandoned his dream of conquest and went home (275
B.C.), and the power of Rome was extended to the Straits of Messina.

On the Sicilian side of the Straits was the Greek city of Messina, and
this presently fell into the hands of a gang of pirates.  The
Carthaginians, who were already practically overlords of Sicily and
allies of Syracuse, suppressed these pirates (270 B.C.) and put in a
Carthaginian garrison there.  The pirates appealed to Rome and Rome
listened to their complaint.  And so across the Straits of Messina the
great trading power of Carthage and this new conquering people, the
Romans, found themselves in antagonism, face to face.




XXXII
ROME AND CARTHAGE


It was in 264 B.C. that the great struggle between Rome and Carthage,
the Punic Wars, began. In that year Asoka was beginning his reign in
Behar and Shi- Hwang-ti was a little child, the Museum in Alexandria
was still doing good scientific work, and the barbaric Gauls were now
in Asia Minor and exacting a tribute from Pergamum. The different
regions of the world were still separated by insurmountable distances,
and probably the rest of mankind heard only vague and remote rumours of
the mortal fight that went on for a century and a half in Spain, Italy,
North Africa and the western Mediterranean, between the last stronghold
of Semitic power and Rome, this newcomer among Aryan-speaking peoples.

That war has left its traces upon issues that still stir the world. 
Rome triumphed over Carthage, but the rivalry of Aryan and Semite was
to merge itself later on in the conflict of Gentile and Jew.  Our
history now is coming to events whose consequences and distorted
traditions still maintain a lingering and expiring vitality in, and
exercise a complicating and confusing influence upon, the conflicts and
controversies of to-day.

The First Punic War began in 264 B.C. about the pirates of Messina.  It
developed into a struggle for the possession of all Sicily except the
dominions of the Greek king of Syracuse.  The advantage of the sea was
at first with the Carthaginians.  They had great fighting ships of what
was hitherto an unheard-of size, quinqueremes, galleys with five banks
of oars and a huge ram.  At the battle of Salamis, two centuries
before, the leading battleships had only been triremes with three
banks.  But the Romans, with extraordinary energy and in spite of the
fact that they had little naval experience, set themselves to outbuild
the Carthaginians.  They manned the new navy they created chiefly with
Greek seamen, and they invented grappling and boarding to make up for
the superior seamanship of the enemy. When the Carthaginian came up to
ram or shear the oars of the Roman, huge grappling irons seized him and
the Roman soldiers swarmed aboard him.  At Myl (260 B.C.) and at
Ecnomus (256 B.C.) the Carthaginians were disastrously beaten. They
repulsed a Roman landing near Carthage but were badly beaten at
Palermo, losing one hundred and four elephants thereto grace such a
triumphal procession through the Forum as Rome had never seen before. 
But after that came two Roman defeats and then a Roman recovery.  The
last naval forces of Carthage were defeated by it last Roman effort at
the battle of the gatian Isles (241 B.C.) and Carthage sued for peace.
 All Sicily except the dominions of Hiero, king of Syracuse, was ceded
to the Romans.

For twenty-two years Rome and Carthage kept the peace.  Both had
trouble enough at home.  In Italy the Gauls came south again,
threatened Rome_which in a state of panic offered human sacrifices to
the Gods!_and were routed at Telamon.  Rome pushed forward to the
Alps, and even extended her dominions down the Adriatic coast to
Illyria. Carthage suffered from domestic insurrections and from revolts
in Corsica and Sardinia, and displayed far less recuperative power. 
Finally, an act of intolerable aggression, Rome seized and annexed the
two revolting islands.

Spain at that time was Carthaginian as far north as the river Ebro.  To
that boundary the Romans restricted them.  Any crossing of the Ebro by
the Carthaginians was to be considered an act of war against the
Romans.  At last in 218 B.C. the Carthaginians, provoked by new Roman
aggressions, did cross this river under a young general named Hannibal,
one of the most brilliant commanders in the whole of history.  He
marched his army from Spain over the Alps into Italy, raised the Gauls
against the Romans, and carried on the Second Punic War in Italy itself
for fifteen years.  He inflicted tremendous defeats upon the Romans at
Lake Trasimere and at Cann, and throughout all his Italian campaigns
no Roman army stood against him and escaped disaster.  But a Roman army
had landed at Marseilles and cut his communications with Spain; he had
no siege train, and he could never capture Rome.  Finally the
Carthaginians, threatened by the revolt of the Numidians at home, were
forced back upon the defence of their own city in Africa, a Roman army
crossed into Africa, and Hannibal experienced his first defeat under
its walls at the battle of Zama (202 B.C. at the hands of Scipio
Africanus the Elder.  The battle of Zama ended this Second Punic War.
Carthage capitulated; she surrendered Spain and her war fleet; she paid
an enormous indemnity and agreed to give up Hannibal to the vengeance
of the Romans.  But Hannibal escaped and fled to Asia where later,
being in danger of falling into the hands of his relentless enemies, he
took poison and died.

For fifty-six years Rome and the shorn city of Carthage were at peace. 
And meanwhile Rome spread her empire over confused and divided Greece,
invaded Asia Minor, and defeated Antiochus III, the Seleucid monarch,
at Magnesia in Lydia. She made Egypt, still under the Ptolemies, and
Pergamum and most of the small states of Asia Minor into Allies, or,
as we should call them now, protected states.

Meanwhile Carthage, subjugated and enfeebled, had been slowly regaining
something of her former prosperity.  Her recovery revived the hate and
suspicion of the Romans.  She was attacked upon the most shallow and
artificial of quarrels (149 B.C.), she made an obstinate and bitter
resistance, stood a long siege and was stormed (146 B.C.). The street
fighting, or massacre, lasted six days; it was extraordinarily bloody,
and when the citadel capitulated only about fifty thousand of the
Carthaginian population remained alive out of a quarter of a million. 
They were sold into slavery, and the city was burnt and elaborately
destroyed.  The blackened ruins were ploughed and sown as a sort of
ceremonial effacement.

So ended the Third Punic War.  Of all the Semitic states and cities
that had flourished in the world five centuries before only one little
country remained free under native rulers. This was Judea, which had
liberated itself from the Seleucids and was under the rule of the
native Maccabean princes. By this time it had its Bible almost
complete, and was developing the distinctive traditions of the Jewish
world as we know it now.  It was natural that the Carthaginians,
Phoenicians and kindred peoples dispersed about the world should find a
common link in their practically identical language and in this
literature of hope and courage.  To a large extent they were still the
traders and bankers of the world.  The Semitic world had been submerged
rather than replaced.

Jerusalem, which has always been rather the symbol than the centre of
Judaism, was taken by the Romans in 65 B.C.; and after various
vicissitudes of quasi- independence and revolt was besieged by them in
70 A.D. and captured after a stubborn struggle. The Temple was
destroyed.  A later rebellion in 132 A.D. completed its destruction,
and the Jerusalem we know to-day was rebuilt later under Roman
auspices.  A temple to the Roman god, Jupiter Capitolinus, stood in the
place of the Temple, and Jews were forbidden to inhabit the city.




XXXIII
THE GROWTH OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE


Now this new Roman power which arose to dominate the western world in
the second and first centuries B.C. was in several respects a different
thing from any of the great empires that had hitherto prevailed in the
civilized world. It was not at first a monarchy, and it was not the
creation of any one great conqueror. It was not indeed the first of
republican empires; Athens had dominated a group of Allies and
dependents in the time of Pericles, and Carthage when she entered upon
her fatal struggle with Rome was mistress of Sardinia and Corsica,
Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and most of Spain and Sicily. But it was the
first republican empire that escaped extinction and went on to fresh
developments.

The centre of this new system lay far to the west of the more ancient
centres of empire, which had hitherto been the river valleys of
Mesopotamia and Egypt.  This westward position enabled Rome to bring in
to civilization quite fresh regions and peoples. The Roman power
extended to Morocco and Spain, and was presently able to thrust
north-westward over what is now France and Belgium to Britain and
north-eastward into Hungary and South Russia.  But on the other hand it
was never able to maintain itself in Central Asia or Persia because
they were too far from its administrative centres.  It included
therefore great masses of fresh Nordic Aryan- speaking peoples, it
presently incorporated nearly all the Greek people in the world, and
its population was less strongly Hamitic and Semitic than that of any
preceding empire.

For some centuries this Roman Empire did not fall into the grooves of
precedent that had so speedily swallowed up Persian and Greek, and all
that time it developed.  The rulers of the Medes and Persians became
entirely Babylonized in a generation or so; they took over the tiara of
the king of kings and the temples and priesthoods of his gods;
Alexander and his successors followed in the same easy path of
assimilation; the Seleucid monarchs had much the same court and
administrative methods as Nebuchadnezzar; the Ptolemies became Pharaohs
and altogether Egyptian.  They were assimilated just as before them the
Semitic conquerors of the Sumerians had been assimilated.  But the
Romans ruled in their own city, and for some centuries kept to the laws
of their own nature.  The only people who exercised any great mental
influence upon them before the second or third century A.D. were the
kindred and similar Greeks.  So that the Roman Empire was essentially a
first attempt to rule a great dominion upon mainly Aryan lines.  It was
so far a new pattern in history, it was an expanded Aryan republic. 
The old pattern of a personal conqueror ruling over a capital city that
had grown up round the temple of a harvest god did not apply to it. 
The Romans had gods and temples, but like the gods of the Greeks their
gods were quasi-human immortals, divine patricians.  The Romans also
had blood sacrifices and even made human ones in times of stress,
things they may have learnt to do from their dusky Etruscan teachers;
but until Rome was long past its zenith neither priest nor temple
played a large part in Roman history.

The Roman Empire was a growth, an unplanned novel growth; the Roman
people found themselves engaged almost unawares in a vast
administrative experiment.  It cannot be called a successful
experiment.  In the end their empire collapsed altogether.  And it
changed enormously in form and method from century to century.  It
changed more in a hundred years than Bengal or Mesopotamia or Egypt
changed in a thousand. It was always changing.  It never attained to
any fixity.

In a sense the experiment failed.  In a sense the experiment remains
unfinished, and Europe and America to-day are still working out the
riddles of world-wide statescraft first confronted by the Roman people.

It is well for the student of history to bear in mind the very great
changes not only in political but in social and moral matters that went
on throughout the period of Roman dominion.  There is much too strong a
tendency in peoples minds to think of the Roman rule as something
finished and stable, firm, rounded, noble and decisive.  Macaulays
_Lays of Ancient Rome_, S.P.Q.R. the elder Cato, the Scipios, Julius
Csar, Diocletian, Constantine the Great, triumphs, orations,
gladiatorial combats and Christian martyrs are all mixed up together in
a picture of something high and cruel and dignified.  The items of that
picture have to be disentangled.  They are collected at different
points from a process of change profounder than that which separates
the London of William the Conqueror from the London of to-day.

We may very conveniently divide the expansion of Rome into four stages.
 The first stage began after the sack of Rome by the Goths in 390 B.C.
and went on until the end of the First Punic War (240 B.C,).  We may
call this stage the stage of the Assimilative Republic.  It was perhaps
the finest, most characteristic stage in Roman history.  The age-long
dissensions of patrician and plebeian were drawing to it close, the
Etruscan threat had come to an end, no one was very rich yet nor very
poor, and most men were public-spirited.  It was a republic like the
republic of the South African Boers before 1900 or like the northern
states of the American union between 1800 and 1850; a free- farmers
republic.  At the outset of this stage Rome was a little state scarcely
twenty miles square.  She fought the sturdy but kindred states about
her, and sought not their destruction but coalescence.  Her centuries
of civil dissension had trained her people in compromise and
concessions.  Some of the defeated cities became altogether Roman with
a voting share in the government, some became self-governing with the
right to trade and marry in Rome; garrisons full of citizens were set
up at strategic points and colonies of varied privileges founded among
the freshly conquered people.  Great roads were made.  The rapid
Latinization of all Italy was the inevitable consequence of such a
policy.  In 89 B.C. all the free inhabitants of Italy became citizens
of the city of Rome.  Formally the whole Roman Empire became at last an
extended city.  In 212 A.D. every free man in the entire extent of the
empire was given citizenship; the right, if he could get there, to vote
in the town meeting in Rome.

This extension of citizenship to tractable cities and to whole
countries was the distinctive device of Roman expansion.  It reversed
the old process of conquest and assimilation altogether.  By the Roman
method the conquerors assimilated the conquered.


THE FORUM AT ROME AS IT IS TO-DAY
THE FORUM AT ROME AS IT IS TO-DAY


But after the First Punic War and the annexation of Sicily, though the
old process of assimilation still went on, another process arose by its
side.  Sicily for instance was treated as a conquered prey.  It was
declared an estate of the Roman people.  Its rich soil and
industrious population was exploited to make Rome rich.  The patricians
and the more influential among the plebeians secured the major share of
that wealth.  And the war also brought in a large supply of slaves. 
Before the First Punic War the population of the republic had been
largely a population of citizen farmers.  Military service was their
privilege and liability.  While they were on active service their farms
fell into debt and a new large-scale slave agriculture grew up; when
they returned they found their produce in competition with slave-grown
produce from Sicily and from the new estates at home.  Times had
changed.  The republic had altered its character.  Not only was Sicily
in the hands of Rome, the common man was in the hands of the rich
creditor and the rich competitor.  Rome had entered upon its second
stage, the Republic of Adventurous Rich Men.

For two hundred years the Roman soldier farmers had struggled for
freedom and a share in the government of their state; for a hundred
years they had enjoyed their privileges.  The First Punic War wasted
them and robbed them of all they had won.

The value of their electoral privileges had also evaporated. The
governing bodies of the Roman republic were two in number.  The first
and more important was the Senate.  This was a body originally of
patricians and then of prominent men of all sorts, who were summoned to
it first by certain powerful officials, the consuls and censors.  Like
the British House of Lords it became a gathering of great landowners,
prominent politicians, big business men and the like. It was much more
like the British House of Lords than it was like the American Senate. 
For three centuries, from the Punic Wars onward, it was the centre of
Roman political thought and purpose.  The second body was the Popular
Assembly.  This was supposed to be an assembly of _all_ the citizens of
Rome.  When Rome was a little state twenty miles square this was a
possible gathering.  When the citizenship of Rome had spread beyond the
confines in Italy, it was an altogether impossible one.  Its meetings,
proclaimed by horn-blowing from the Capitol and the city walls, became
more and more a gathering of political hacks and city riff-raff.  In
the fourth century B.C. the Popular Assembly was a considerable check
upon the Senate, a competent representation of the claims and rights of
the common man.  By the end of the Punic Wars it was an impotent relic
of a vanquished popular control.  No effectual legal check remained
upon the big men.

THE GREAT ROMAN ARCH AT CTESIPHON NEAR BAGDAD


Nothing of the nature of representative government was ever introduced
into the Roman republic.  No one thought of electing delegates to
represent the will of the citizens. This is a very important point for
the student to grasp.  The Popular Assembly never became the equivalent
of the American House of Representatives or the British House of
Commons.  In theory it was all the citizens; in practice it ceased to
be anything at all worth consideration.

The common citizen of the Roman Empire was therefore in a very poor
case after the Second Punic War; he was impoverished, he had often lost
his farm, he was ousted from profitable production by slaves, and he
had no political power left to him to remedy these things.  The only
methods of popular expression left to a people without any form of
political expression are the strike and the revolt.  The story of the
second and first centuries B.C., so far as internal politics go, is a
story of futile revolutionary upheaval.  The scale of this history will
not permit us to tell of the intricate struggles of that time, of the
attempts to break up estates and restore the land to the free farmer,
of proposals to abolish debts in whole or in part.  There was revolt
and civil war.  In 73 B.C., the distresses of Italy were enhanced by a
great insurrection, of the slaves under Spartacus.  The slaves of Italy
revolted with some effect, for among them were the trained fighters of
the gladiatorial shows.  For two years Spartacus held out in the crater
of Vesuvius, which seemed at that time to be an extinct volcano. This
insurrection was defeated at last and suppressed with frantic cruelty. 
Six thousand captured Spartacists were crucified along the Appian Way,
the great highway that runs southward out of Rome (71 B.C.).

The common man never made head against the forces that were subjugating
and degrading him.  But the big rich men who were overcoming him were
even in his defeat preparing a new power in the Roman world over
themselves and him, the power of the army.

Before the Second Punic War the army of Rome was a levy of free
farmers, who, according to their quality, rode or marched afoot to
battle.  This was a very good force for wars close at hand, but not the
sort of army that will go abroad and bear long campaigns with patience.
 And moreover as the slaves multiplied and the estates grew, the supply
of free- spirited fighting farmers declined.  It was a popular leader
named Marius who introduced a new factor.  North Africa after the
overthrow of the Carthaginian civilization had become a semi-barbaric
kingdom, the kingdom of Numidia.  The Roman power fell into conflict
with Jugurtha, king of this state, and experienced enormous
difficulties in subduing him. Marius was made consul, in a phase of
public indignation, to end this discreditable war.  This he did by
raising _paid troops_ and drilling them hard.  Jugurtha was brought in
chains to Rome (106 B.C.) and Marius, when his time of office had
expired, held on to his consulship illegally with his newly created
legions.  There was no power in Rome to restrain him.

With Marius began the third phase in the development of the Roman
power, the Republic of the Military Commanders.  For now began a period
in which the leaders of the paid legions fought for the mastery of the
Roman world.  Against Marius was pitted the aristocratic Sulla who had
served under him in Africa.  Each in turn made a great massacre of his
political opponents.  Men were proscribed and executed by the thousand,
and their estates were sold.  After the bloody rivalry of these two and
the horror of the revolt of Spartacus, came a phase in which Lucullus
and Pompey the Great and Crassus and Julius Csar were the masters of
armies and dominated affairs.  It was Crassus who defeated Spartacus. 
Lucullus conquered Asia Minor and penetrated to Armenia, and retired
with great wealth into private life.  Crassus thrusting further invaded
Persia and was defeated and slain by the Parthians.  After a long
rivalry Pompey was defeated by Julius Csar (48 B.C.) and murdered in
Egypt, leaving Julius Csar sole master of the Roman world.

The figure of Julius Csar is one that has stirred the human
imagination out of all proportion to its merit or true importance.  He
has become a legend and a symbol.  For us he is chiefly important as
marking the transition from the phase of military adventurers to the
beginning of the fourth stage in Roman expansion, the Early Empire. 
For in spite of the profoundest economic and political convulsions, in
spite of civil war and social degeneration, throughout all this time
the boundaries of the Roman state crept outward and continued to creep
outward to their maximum about 100 A.D.  There had been something like
an ebb during the doubtful phases of the Second Punic War, and again a
manifest loss of vigour before the reconstruction of the army by
Marius. The revolt of Spartacus marked a third phase.  Julius Csar
made his reputation as a military leader in Gaul, which is now France
and Belgium.  (The chief tribes inhabiting this country belonged to the
same Celtic people as the Gauls who had occupied north Italy for a
time, and who had afterwards raided into Asia Minor and settled down as
the Galatians.)  Csar drove back a German invasion of Gaul and added
all that country to the empire, and he twice crossed the Straits of
Dover into Britain (55 and 54 B.C.), where however he made no permanent
conquest.  Meanwhile Pompey the Great was consolidating Roman conquests
that reached in the east to the Caspian Sea.

At this time, the middle of the first century B.C., the Roman Senate
was still the nominal centre of the Roman government, appointing
consuls and other officials, granting powers and the like; and a number
of politicians, among whom Cicero was an outstanding figure, were
struggling to preserve the great traditions of republican Rome and to
maintain respect for its laws.  But the spirit of citizenship had gone
from Italy with the wasting away of the free farmers; it was a land now
of slaves and impoverished men with neither the understanding nor the
desire for freedom.  There was nothing whatever behind these republican
leaders in the Senate, while behind the great adventurers they feared
and desired to control were the legions.  Over the heads of the Senate
Crassus and Pompey and Csar divided the rule of the Empire between
them (The First Triumvirate).  When presently Crassus was killed at
distant Carrh by the Parthians, Pompey and Csar fell out. Pompey took
up the republican side, and laws were passed to bring Csar to trial
for his breaches of law and his disobedience to the decrees of the
Senate.

It was illegal for a general to bring his troops out of the boundary of
his command, and the boundary between Csars command and Italy was the
Rubicon.  In 49 B.C. he crossed the Rubicon, saying The die is cast
and marched upon Pompey and Rome.

It had been the custom in Rome in the past, in periods of military
extremity, to elect a dictator with practically unlimited powers to
rule through the crisis. After his overthrow of Pompey, Csar was made
dictator first for ten years and then (in 45 B.C.) for life.  In effect
he was made monarch of the empire for life.  There was talk of a king,
a word abhorrent to Rome since the expulsion of the Etruscans five
centuries before.  Csar refused to be king, but adopted throne and
sceptre.  After his defeat of Pompey, Csar had gone on into Egypt and
had made love to Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, the goddess
queen of Egypt.  She seems to have turned his head very completely.  He
had brought back to Rome the Egyptian idea of a god-king.  His statue
was set up in a temple with an inscription To the Unconquerable God. 
The expiring republicanism of Rome flared up in a last protest, and
Csar was stabbed to death in the Senate at the foot of the statue of
his murdered rival, Pompey the Great.

Thirteen years more of this conflict of ambitious personalities
followed.  There was a second Triumvirate of Lepidus, Mark Antony and
Octavian Csar, the latter the nephew of Julius Csar.  Octavian like
his uncle took the poorer, hardier western provinces where the best
legions were recruited.  In 31 B.C., he defeated Mark Antony, his only
serious rival, at the naval battle of Actium, and made himself sole
master of the Roman world.  But Octavian was a man of different quality
altogether from Julius Csar.  He had no foolish craving to be God or
King.  He had no queen-lover that he wished to dazzle.  He restored
freedom to the Senate and people of Rome.  He declined to be dictator. 
The grateful Senate in return gave him the reality instead of the forms
of power. He was to be called not King indeed, but Princeps and
Augustus.  He became Augustus Csar, the first of the Roman emperors
(27 B.C. to 14 A.D.).

He was followed by Tiberius Csar (14 to 37 A.D.) and he by others,
Caligula, Claudius, Nero and so on up to Trajan (98 A.D.), Hadrian (117
A.D.), Antonius Pius (138 A.D.) and Marcus Aurelius (161- 180 A.D.). 
All these emperors were emperors of the legions.  The soldiers made
them, and some the soldiers destroyed.  Gradually the Senate fades out
of Roman-history, and the emperor and his administrative officials
replace it.  The boundaries of the empire crept forward now to their
utmost limits.  Most of Britain was added to the empire, Transylvania
was brought in as a new province, Dacia; Trajan crossed the Euphrates. 
Hadrian had an idea that reminds us at once of what had happened at the
other end of the old world.  Like Shi-Hwang-ti he built walls against
the northern barbarians; one across Britain and a palisade between the
Rhine and the Danube.  He abandoned some of the acquisitions of Trajan.

The expansion of the Roman Empire was at an end.




XXXIV
BETWEEN ROME AND CHINA


The second and first centuries B.C. mark a new phase in the history of
mankind. Mesopotamia and the eastern Mediterranean are no longer the
centre of interest. Both Mesopotamia and Egypt were still fertile,
populous and fairly prosperous, but they were no longer the dominant
regions of the world. Power had drifted to the west and to the east.
Two great empires now dominated the world, this new Roman Empire and
the renascent Empire of China. Rome extended its power to the
Euphrates, but it was never able to get beyond that boundary. It was
too remote. Beyond the Euphrates the former Persian and Indian
dominions of the Seleucids fell under a number of new masters. China,
now under the Han dynasty, which had replaced the Tsin dynasty at the
death of Shi-Hwang-ti, had extended its power across Tibet and over the
high mountain passes of the Pamirs into western Turkestan. But there,
too, it reached its extremes. Beyond was too far.

China at this time was the greatest, best organized and most civilized
political system in the world.  It was superior in area and population
to the Roman Empire at its zenith.  It was possible then for these two
vast systems to flourish in the same world at the same time in almost
complete ignorance of each other.  The means of communication both by
sea and land was not yet sufficiently developed and organized for them
to come to a direct clash.

Yet they reacted upon each other in a very remarkable way, and their
influence upon the fate of the regions that lay between them, upon
central Asia and India, was profound.  A certain amount of trade
trickled through, by camel caravans across Persia, for example, and by
coasting ships by way of India and the Red Sea.  In 66 B.C. Roman
troops under Pompey followed in the footsteps of Alexander the Great,
and marched up the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea.  In 102 A.D. a
Chinese expeditionary force under Pan Chau reached the Caspian, and
sent emissaries to report upon the power of Rome.  But many centuries
were still to pass before definite knowledge and direct intercourse
were to link the great parallel worlds of Europe and Eastern Asia.

To the north of both these great empires were barbaric wildernesses. 
What is now Germany was largely forest lands; the forests extended far
into Russia and made a home for the gigantic aurochs, a bull of almost
elephantine size.  Then to the north of the great mountain masses of
Asia stretched a band of deserts, steppes and then forests and frozen
lands. In the eastward lap of the elevated part of Asia was the great
triangle of Manchuria.  Large parts of these regions, stretching
between South Russia and Turkestan into Manchuria, were and are regions
of exceptional climatic insecurity. Their rainfall has varied greatly
in the course of a few centuries  They are lands treacherous to man. 
For years they will carry pasture and sustain cultivation, and then
will come an age of decline in humidity and a cycle of killing
droughts.

The western part of this barbaric north from the German forests to
South Russia and Turkestan and from Gothland to the Alps was the region
of origin of the Nordic peoples and of the Aryan speech.  The eastern
steppes and deserts of Mongolia was the region of origin of the Hunnish
or Mongolian or Tartar or Turkish peoplesfor all these several peoples
were akin in language, race, and way of life.  And as the Nordic
peoples seem to have been continually overflowing their own borders and
pressing south upon the developing civilizations of Mesopotamia and the
Mediterranean coast, so the Hunnish tribes sent their surplus as
wanderers, raiders and conquerors into the settled regions of China. 
Periods of plenty in the north would mean an increase in population
there; a shortage of grass, a spell of cattle disease, would drive the
hungry warlike tribesmen south.

For a time there were simultaneously two fairly effective Empires in
the world capable of holding back the barbarians and even forcing
forward the frontiers of the imperial peace. The thrust of the Han
empire from north China into Mongolia was strong and continuous.  The
Chinese population welled up over the barrier of the Great Wall. 
Behind the imperial frontier guards came the Chinese farmer with horse
and plough, ploughing up the grass lands and enclosing the winter
pasture.  The Hunnish peoples raided and murdered the settlers, but the
Chinese punitive expeditions were too much for them.  The nomads were
faced with the choice of settling down to the plough and becoming
Chinese tax-payers or shifting in search of fresh summer pastures. 
Some took the former course and were absorbed.  Some drifted
north-eastward and eastward over the mountain passes down into western
Turkestan.

This westward drive of the Mongolian horsemen was going on from 200
B.C. onward.  It was producing a westward pressure upon the Aryan
tribes, and these again were pressing upon the Roman frontiers ready to
break through directly there was any weakness apparent.  The Parthians,
who were apparently a Scythian people with some Mongolian admixture,
came down to the Euphrates by the first century B.C.  They fought
against Pompey the Great in his eastern raid.  They defeated and killed
Crassus.  They replaced the Seleucid monarchy in Persia by a dynasty of
Parthian kings, the Arsacid dynasty.

But for a time the line of least resistance for hungry nomads lay
neither to the west nor the east but through central Asia and then
south-eastward through the Khyber Pass into India. It was India which
received the Mongolian drive in these centuries of Roman and Chinese
strength.  A series of raiding conquerors poured down through the
Punjab into the great plains to loot and destroy.  The empire of Asoka
was broken up, and for a time the history of India passes into
darkness. A certain Kushan dynasty founded by the Indo- Scythiansone
of the raiding peoplesruled for a time over North India and maintained
a certain order. These invasions went on for several centuries.  For a
large part of the fifth century A.D. India was afflicted by the
Ephthalites or White Huns, who levied tribute on the small Indian
princes and held India in terror. Every summer these Ephthalites
pastured in western Turkestan, every autumn they came down through the
passes to terrorize India.

In the second century A.D. a great misfortune came upon the Roman and
Chinese empires that probably weakened the resistance of both to
barbarian pressure.  This was a pestilence of unexampled virulence.  It
raged for eleven years in China and disorganized the social framework
profoundly.  The Han dynasty fell, and a new age of division and
confusion began from which China did not fairly recover until the
seventh century A.D. with the coming of the great Tang dynasty.

The infection spread through Asia to Europe.  It raged throughout the
Roman Empire from 164 to 180 A.D.  It evidently weakened the Roman
imperial fabric very seriously.  We begin to hear of depopulation in
the Roman provinces after this, and there was a marked deterioration in
the vigour and efficiency of government.  At any rate we presently find
the frontier no longer invulnerable, but giving way first in this place
and then in that.  A new Nordic people, the Goths, coming originally
from Gothland in Sweden, had migrated across Russia to the Volga region
and the shores of the Black Sea and taken to the sea and piracy.  By
the end of the second century they may have begun to feel the westward
thrust of the Huns.  In 247 they crossed the Danube in a great land
raid, and defeated and killed the Emperor Decius in a battle in what is
now Serbia. In 236 another Germanic people, the Franks, had broken
bounds upon the lower Rhine, and the Alemanni had poured into Alsace. 
The legions in Gaul beat back their invaders, but the Goths in the
Balkan peninsula raided again and again. The province of Dacia vanished
from Roman history.

A chill had come to the pride and confidence of Rome.  In 270-275 Rome,
which had been an open and secure city for three centuries, was
fortified by the Emperor Aurelian.




XXXV
THE COMMON MANS LIFE UNDER THE EARLY ROMAN EMPIRE


Before we tell of how this Roman empire which was built up in the two
centuries B.C., and which flourished in peace and security from the
days of Augustus Csar onward for two centuries, fell into disorder and
was broken up, it may be as well to devote some attention to the life
of the ordinary people throughout this great realm. Our history has
come down now to within 2000 years of our own time; and the life of the
civilized people, both under the Peace of Rome and the Peace of the Han
dynasty, was beginning to resemble more and more clearly the life of
their civilized successors to-day.

In the western world coined money was now in common use; outside the
priestly world there were many people of independent means who were
neither officials of the government nor priests; people travelled about
more freely than they had ever done before, and there were high roads
and inns for them. Compared with the past, with the time before 500
B.C., life had become much more loose. Before that date civilized men
had been bound to a district or country, had been bound to a tradition
and lived within a very limited horizon; only the nomads traded and
travelled.

But neither the Roman Peace nor the Peace of the Han dynasty meant a
uniform civilization over the large areas they controlled.  There were
very great local differences and great contrasts and inequalities of
culture between one district and another, just as there are to-day
under the British Peace in India.  The Roman garrisons and colonies
were dotted here and there over this great space, worshipping Roman
gods and speaking the Latin language; but where there had been towns
and cities before the coming of the Romans, they went on, subordinated
indeed but managing their own affairs, and, for a time at least,
worshipping their own gods in their own fashion.  Over Greece, Asia
Minor, Egypt and the Hellenized East generally, the Latin language
never prevailed.  Greek ruled there invincibly.  Saul of Tarsus, who
became the apostle Paul, was a Jew and a Roman citizen; but he spoke
and wrote Greek and not Hebrew.  Even at the court of the Parthian
dynasty, which had overthrown the Greek Seleucids in Persia, and was
quite outside the Roman imperial boundaries, Greek was the fashionable
language.  In some parts of Spain and in North Africa, the Carthaginian
language also held on for a long time in spite of the destruction of
Carthage.  Such a town as Seville, which had been a prosperous city
long before the Roman name had been heard of, kept its Semitic goddess
and preserved its Semitic speech for generations, in spite of a colony
of Roman veterans at Italica a few miles away.  Septimius Severus, who
was emperor from 193 to 211 A.D., spoke Carthaginian as his mother
speech.  He learnt Latin later as a foreign tongue; and it is recorded
that his sister never learnt Latin and conducted her Roman household in
the Punic language.

In such countries as Gaul and Britain and in provinces like Dacia (now
roughly Roumania) and Pannonia (Hungary south of the Danube), where
there were no pre-existing great cities and temples and cultures, the
Roman empire did however Latinize.  It civilized these countries for
the first time.  It created cities and towns where Latin was from the
first the dominant speech, and where Roman gods were served and Roman
customs and fashions followed.  The Roumanian, Italian, French and
Spanish languages, all variations and modifications of Latin, remain to
remind us of this extension of Latin speech and customs.  North-west
Africa also became at last largely Latin-speaking.  Egypt, Greece and
the rest of the empire to the east were never Latinized.  They remained
Egyptian and Greek in culture and spirit.  And even in Rome, among
educated men, Greek was learnt as the language of a gentleman and Greek
literature and learning were very, properly preferred to Latin.

In this miscellaneous empire the ways of doing work and business were
naturally also very miscellaneous.  The chief industry of the settled
world was still largely agriculture. We have told how in Italy the
sturdy free farmers who were the backbone of the early Roman republic
were replaced by estates worked by slave labour after the Punic wars. 
The Greek world had had very various methods of cultivation, from the
Arcadian plan, wherein every free citizen toiled with his own hands, to
Sparta, wherein it was a dishonour to work and where agricultural work
was done by a special slave class, the Helots.  But that was ancient
history now, and over most of the Hellenized world the estate system
and slave-gangs had spread.  The agricultural slaves were captives who
spoke many different languages so that they could not understand each
other, or they were born slaves; they had no solidarity to resist
oppression, no tradition of rights, no knowledge, for they could not
read nor write.  Although they came to form a majority of the country
population they never made a successful insurrection.  The insurrection
of Spartacus in the first century B.C. was an insurrection of the
special slaves who were trained for the gladiatorial combats. The
agricultural workers in Italy in the latter days of the Republic and
the early Empire suffered frightful indignities; they would be chained
at night to prevent escape or have half the head shaved to make it
difficult.  They had no wives of their own; they could be outraged,
mutilated and killed by their masters.  A master could sell his slave
to fight beasts in the arena.  If a slave slew his master, all the
slaves in his household and not merely the murderer were crucified.  In
some parts of Greece, in Athens notably, the lot of the slave was never
quite so frightful as this, but it was still detestable.  To such a
population the barbarian invaders who presently broke through the
defensive line of the legions, came not as enemies but as liberators.

The slave system had spread to most industries and to every sort of
work that could be done by gangs.  Mines and metallurgical operations,
the rowing of galleys, road-making and big building operations were all
largely slave occupations.  And almost all domestic service was
performed by slaves.  There were poor free-men and there were freed-men
in the cities and upon the country side, working for themselves or even
working for wages.  They were artizans, supervisors and so forth,
workers of a new money- paid class working in competition with slave
workers; but we do not know what proportion they made of the general
population.  It probably varied widely in different places and at
different periods.  And there were also many modifications of slavery,
from the slavery that was chained at night and driven with whips to the
farm or quarry, to the slave whose master found it advantageous to
leave him to cultivate his patch or work his craft and own his wife
like a free-man, provided he paid in a satisfactory quittance to his
owner.

There were armed slaves.  At the opening of the period of the Punic
wars, in 264 B.C., the Etruscan sport of setting slaves to fight for
their lives was revived in Rome.  It grew rapidly fashionable; and soon
every great Roman rich man kept a retinue of gladiators, who sometimes
fought in the arena but whose real business it was to act as his
bodyguard of bullies.  And also there were learned slaves.  The
conquests of the later Republic were among the highly civilized cities
of Greece, North Africa and Asia Minor; and they brought in many highly
educated captives. The tutor of a young Roman of good family was
usually a slave.  A rich man would have a Greek slave as librarian, and
slave secretaries and learned men.  He would keep his poet as he would
keep a performing dog.  In this atmosphere of slavery the traditions of
modern literary criticism were evolved.  The slaves still boast and
quarrel in our reviews. There were enterprising people who bought
intelligent boy slaves and had them educated for sale.  Slaves were
trained as book copyists, as jewellers, and for endless skilled
callings.

But there were very considerable changes in the position of a slave
during the four hundred years between the opening days of conquest
under the republic of rich men and the days of disintegration that
followed the great pestilence.  In the second century B.C. war-captives
were abundant, manners gross and brutal; the slave had no rights and
there was scarcely an outrage the reader can imagine that was not
practised upon slaves in those days.  But already in the first century
A.D. there was a perceptible improvement in the attitude of the Roman
civilization towards slavery.  Captives were not so abundant for one
thing, and slaves were dearer.  And slave- owners began to realize that
the profit and comfort they got from their slaves increased with the
self-respect of these unfortunates.  But also the moral tone of the
community was rising, and a sense of justice was becoming effective. 
The higher mentality of Greece was qualifying the old Roman harshness. 
Restrictions upon cruelty were made, a master might no longer sell his
slave to fight beasts, a slave was given property rights in what was
called his _peculium_, slaves were paid wages as an encouragement and
stimulus, a form of slave marriage was recognized.  Very many forms of
agriculture do not lend themselves to gang working, or require gang
workers only at certain seasons.  In regions where such conditions
prevailed the slave presently became a serf, paying his owner part of
his produce or working for him at certain seasons.

When we begin to realize how essentially this great Latin and
Greek-speaking Roman Empire of the first two centuries A.D. was a slave
state and how small was the minority who had any pride or freedom in
their lives, we lay our hands on the clues to its decay and collapse. 
There was little of what we should call family life, few homes of
temperate living and active thought and study; schools and colleges
were few and far between.  The free will and the free mind were nowhere
to be found.  The great roads, the ruins of splendid buildings, the
tradition of law and power it left for the astonishment of succeeding
generations must not conceal from us that all its outer splendour was
built upon thwarted wills, stifled intelligence, and crippled and
perverted desires.  And even the minority who lorded it over that wide
realm of subjugation and of restraint and forced labour were uneasy and
unhappy in their souls; art and literature, science and philosophy,
which are the fruits of free and happy minds, waned in that atmosphere.
 There was much copying and imitation, an abundance of artistic
artificers, much slavish pedantry among the servile men of learning,
but the whole Roman empire in four centuries produced nothing to set
beside the bold and noble intellectual activities of the comparatively
little city of Athens during its one century of greatness.  Athens
decayed under the Roman sceptre.  The science of Alexandria decayed.
The spirit of man, it seemed, was decaying in those days.




XXXVI
RELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENTS UNDER THE ROMAN EMPIRE


The soul of man under that Latin and Greek empire of the first two
centuries of the Christian era was a worried and frustrated soul.
Compulsion and cruelty reigned; there were pride and display but little
honour; little serenity or steadfast happiness. The unfortunate were
despised and wretched; the fortunate were insecure and feverishly eager
for gratifications. In a great number of cities life centred on the red
excitement of the arena, where men and beasts fought and were tormented
and slain. Amphitheatres are the most characteristic of Roman ruins.
Life went on in that key. The uneasiness of mens hearts manifested
itself in profound religious unrest.

From the days when the Aryan hordes first broke in upon the ancient
civilizations, it was inevitable that the old gods of the temples and
priesthoods should suffer great adaptations or disappear.  In the
course of hundreds of generations the agricultural peoples of the
brunette civilizations had shaped their lives and thoughts to the
temple-centred life. Observances and the fear of disturbed routines,
sacrifices and mysteries, dominated their minds.  Their gods seem
monstrous and illogical to our modern minds because we belong to an
Aryanized world, but to these older peoples these deities had the
immediate conviction and vividness of things seen in an intense dream. 
The conquest of one city state by another in Sumeria or early Egypt
meant a change or a renaming of gods or goddesses, but left the shape
and spirit of the worship intact.  There was no change in its general
character.  The figures in the dream changed, but the dream went on and
it was the same sort of dream.  And the early Semitic conquerors were
sufficiently akin in spirit to the Sumerians to take over the religion
of the Mesopotamian civilization they subjugated without any profound
alteration. Egypt was never indeed subjugated to the extent of a
religious revolution.  Under the Ptolemies and under the Csars, her
temples and altars and priesthoods remained essentially Egyptian.

So long as conquests went on between people of similar social and
religious habits it was possible to get over the clash between the god
of this temple and region and the god of that by a process of grouping
or assimilation.  If the two gods were alike in character they were
identified.  It was really the same god under another name, said the
priests and the people.  This fusion of gods is called theocrasia; and
the age of the great conquests of the thousand years B.C. was an age of
theocrasia.  Over wide areas the local gods were displaced by, or
rather they were swallowed up in, a general god.  So that when at last
Hebrew prophets in Babylon proclaimed one God of Righteousness in all
the earth mens minds were fully prepared for that idea.

But often the gods were too dissimilar for such an assimilation, and
then they were grouped together in some plausible relationship.  A
female god - and the gean world before the coming of the Greek was
much addicted to Mother Godswould be married to a male god, and an
animal god or a star god would be humanized and the animal or
astronomical aspect, the serpent or the sun or the star, made into an
ornament or a symbol.  Or the god of a defeated people would become a
malignant antagonist to the brighter gods.  The history of theology is
full of such adaptations, compromises and rationalizations of once
local gods.

As Egypt developed from city states into one united kingdom there was
much of this theocrasia.  The chief god so to speak was Osiris, a
sacrificial harvest god of whom Pharaoh was supposed to be the earthly
incarnation.  Osiris was represented as repeatedly dying and rising
again; he was not only the seed and the harvest but also by a natural
extension of thought the means of human immortality.  Among his symbols
was the wide-winged scarabeus beetle which buries its eggs to rise
again, and also the effulgent sun which sets to rise. Later on he was
to be identified with Apis, the sacred bull. Associated with him was
the goddess Isis.  Isis was also Hathor, a cow-goddess, and the
crescent moon and the Star of the sea.  Osiris dies and she bears a
child, Horus, who is also a hawk-god and the dawn, and who grows to
become Osiris again.  The effigies of Isis represent her as bearing the
infant Horus in her arms and standing on the crescent moon.  These are
not logical relationships, but they were devised by the human mind
before the development of hard and systematic thinking and they have a
dream-like coherence.  Beneath this triple group there are other and
darker Egyptian gods, bad gods, the dog-headed Anubis, black night and
the like, devourers, tempters, enemies of god and man.
